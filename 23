//The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
//F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
//F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
//Given N, calculate F(N).
//Example 1:  Input: 2, Output: 1
//Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
